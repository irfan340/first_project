        <p><strong> HTML, or <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em></strong>, is the cornerstone of web development and plays 
            a pivotal role in creating and structuring web pages. It uses a system of tags and
            elements to define the content and layout of a webpage, allowing web developers to
            convey information effectively.</p>
        <p>HTML's support for multimedia integration is highlighted. By incorporating tags like
           <strong><em>img</em></strong> for images and <strong><em>video</em></strong> for videos, developers can enrich web content with 
           visual and auditory elements. HTML's versatility in handling multimedia assets 
           contributes to creating engaging and interactive web experiences, catering to 
           diverse user preferences and expectations.</p>
